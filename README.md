# NefariousNebulaGame
A simple game coded in Scratch language to familiarize myself with the language.

Take off in your spaceship and explore the nebula by moving the mouse (the spaceship follows). Be careful because there are nefarious nebula ghosts out there, you wouldn't want one to catch you! How long can you play without touching a ghost?

* Load game and push the Launch Button to start.
* After a short take-off animation, the rocket ship will follow your mouse and ghosts will begin to appear.
* Move the mouse to avoid your rocket ship touching the ghosts.
* That's it, have fun!
